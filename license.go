// license.go -- all the Frosted Markdown licensing that's fit to print!
//
// (Presumably not worth using bindoc just for this.)
//
// Up to date as of Sat., 17 December 2016.
//
// NOTE (mostly to self): since most of the licenses have a clause about
// including the license in distributions, and all kinds of software is
// distributed as single-file binaries, are you not violating the license
// if you don't have something like the --license option in the binary?
// Source distros wouldn't need this as it's going to be in the source of
// the deps, even if they're vendored in.  But don't the license files just
// disappear otherwise?
//
// ADDITIONAL NOTE / TODO: ERGO update this source file from the vendor dir,
// with a little utility to do that (again, not worth bindoc for this).
// Find everything named LICENSE, determine what it belongs to, and create
// a little file with a single function returning all of them (deduped).
// Maybe call it... deplic?
