# README: Frosted Markdown for Perl

**THIS IS UNFINISHED SOFTWARE! DO NOT USE!**

Frosted Markdown is primarily a Go project, simply because the things I need
it to work with are being written in Go. Also, I like the idea of the `fmd`
program becoming my primary Markdown converter.

(Yeah, yeah, scope creep...)

For various reasons, I also want to have a Perl library that does more or
less the same thing. "More or less" because I probably won't bother to port
Blackfriday, simply for lack of time. And I really like Blackfriday.

Anyway, that's what this directory is doing under a project that is otherwise
all Golang.  When (if) I find time to work on the Perl I want to keep it in
sync with the Go version.
